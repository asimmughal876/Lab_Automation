							<p>Laboratory services are used by outside laboratories that do not have the means to test certain specimens. A laboratory is a facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans to provide information for diagnosis, prevention or treatment of or impairment of disease, or for assessment of health.</p>

							<p>Clinical laboratory tests are used for a wide variety of purposes, including the following: Identifying signs of nutrient deficiencies. Detecting any changes in your health. Evaluating bodily functions, such as the kidney, liver, or thyroid function.</p>

							<p>A medical laboratory or clinical laboratory is a laboratory where tests are conducted out
								on
								clinical specimens to obtain information about the health of a patient to aid in
								diagnosis,
								treatment, and prevention of disease.Clinical medical laboratories are an example of
								applied
								science, as opposed to research laboratories that focus on basic science, such as found
								in
								some academic institutions.</p>

							<p>
								Medical laboratories vary in size and complexity and so offer a variety of testing
								services.
								More comprehensive services can be found in acute-care hospitals and medical centers,
								where
								70% of clinical decisions are based on laboratory testing. Doctors offices and clinics,
								as
								well as skilled nursing and long-term care facilities, may have laboratories that
								provide
								more basic testing services. Commercial medical laboratories operate as independent
								businesses and provide testing that is otherwise not provided in other settings due to
								low
								test volume or complexity.</p>

							<h3 class="text-md-start text-center">Genetics</h3>
							<p>Clinical Molecular Genetics is a laboratory-based specialty of medical genetics that
								focuses on the discovery of and laboratory testing for DNA mutations that underlie
								disease. Clinical Molecular Genetics is recognized as a primary specialty by the
								ABMS</p>

							<p>Laboratory Genetics and Genomics is a new specialty of the American Board of Medical
								Genetics and Genomics that incorporates training in both molecular and cytogenetic
								techniques and interpretations in a single 24-month program.</p>

							<p>
								Clinical Laboratory Geneticists are certified to perform and interpret genetic tests
								that are important for diagnosing and managing genetic diseases. They primarily work in
								genetic testing labs that are part of either academic or research institutions,
								hospitals, or private diagnostic companies.
